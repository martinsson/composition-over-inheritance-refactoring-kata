# Context
You have a restaurant, initially you had only a single menu, but then you found a way
to extend your offer with one and then two more menus, by simply varying one of the dishes. Great!

Recently snobby people started asking for a no-gluten menu.

# Objective
Provide the functionnality corresponding to a no-gluten menu. 
Since you already serve filet mignon and cr√®me caramel you already have everything you need.

# Technical discussion
One of the problems can be seen in this [diagram](./inheritance_problem.puml)
